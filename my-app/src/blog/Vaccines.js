                    In the United States, vaccines are widely accepted as safe and effective. 
                    During the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, a vaccine was quickly 
                    developed to fight against the covid-19 virus to weaken 
                    the effects and irradicate the virus.

                    Many adopted the policy of requiring vaccines for public 
                    safety. However, there are some "anti-vaxxers" who thought 
                    they knew better and had various reasons for opposing the 
                    vaccine even at the risk of harming themselves and their community.

                    some cite autism, others cite myocarditis, and others 
                    are simply skeptical of the medical community.

                    Curious about their opinion, I decided to do my own research about 
                    vaccines, how they work, why there is criticism and what the 
                    arguments for and against. I read studies published by the 
                    CDC and the NIH. This is a very contentious topic, and I felt 
                    it a good idea to be informed to understand both sides.

                    Why were vaccines developed?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course of history, humans and diseases have 
                    evolved, exposing humans to various different illnesses; many 
                    of which are deadly. Vaccines were developed to save lives 
                    and assist in human protection against disease.  
                    The first documented vaccine was developed in 1796 by Dr.
                    Edward Jenner who discovered that exposing humans to cowpox 
                    would make them immune to smallpox.
