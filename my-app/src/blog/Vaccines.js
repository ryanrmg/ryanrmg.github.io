                    In the United States and most of the rest of the world, vaccines 
                    are widely accepted as safe and effective. Vaccines save 
                    lives and protect us; allowing us to travel to locations that may 
                    expose us to foreign pathogens we have not encountered before. 
                    We develop immunity before we depart with vaccines.
                    However, there are 
                    a few skeptics or "anti-vaxxers" that beleive that medical 
                    doctors are doing more harm than good.
                    During the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, a vaccine was quickly 
                    developed to fight against the covid-19 virus to weaken 
                    the effects and irradicate the virus. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many adopted the policy of requiring vaccines for public 
                    safety. But the "anti-vaxxers" argued vehemently against these policies,
                    even at the risk of harming themselves and their community.
                    Refusing to trust <span id="coral">the science&trade;</span>,
                    this group chose to cite autism, myocarditis, and skepticism
                    towards the medical community as valid reasons to endanger their 
                    loved ones, neighbors and all of humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Curious about their opinion, I decided to do my own research about 
                    vaccines, how they work, why there is criticism and what the 
                    arguments for and against. I read studies published by the 
                    CDC and the NIH. This is a very contentious topic, and I felt 
                    it a good idea to be informed to understand both sides. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following is a summary of my findings. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why were vaccines developed?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course of history, humans and diseases have 
                    evolved, exposing humans to various different illnesses; many 
                    of which are deadly. Vaccines were developed to save lives 
                    and assist in human protection against disease. Vaccines 
                    stimulate the immune system and enable it to recognize and 
                    fight disease without causing the disease itself. 
                    The first documented vaccine was developed in 1796 by Dr.
                    Edward Jenner who discovered that exposing humans to cowpox 
                    would make them immune to smallpox. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How do vaccines work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and 
                    combat pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria, without causing 
                    the disease itself.
                </p>
                <h2>The mRNA vaccine</h2>
                <p>
                    A newly developed form of vaccine which uses messenger RNA 
                    to instruct cells to produce a protein 
                    that is part of the pathogen, prompting an immune response. 
                    Pfizer and Moderna developed a mRNA vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Questions I pondered myself:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why do doctors receive bonuses for vaccinating patients?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to beleive the healthcare industry cares about the health of the American people. 
                    Maybe doctors who convince 'anti-vaxxers' to get vaccines deserves a bonus for their service to herd immunity and 
                    health of the American and World population. After all, vaccines are a trillion dollar business. 
                    Pfizer's vaccine revenue in 2021 was $43,000,000,000 (43 billion). 
                    Moderna's was $17,000,000,000 (17 billion).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why do vaccines contain mercury? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thimerosol is a preservative to prevent contamination. 
                    There is no link between thimerosol and autism. Thimerosol 
                    was removed from all childhoold vaccines in 2001.
